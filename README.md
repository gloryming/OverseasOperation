# Overseas Operation 

This repo just sharing little overseas operation experience of App &amp; Game during my work.

## Start with Why

Many indie developers are stucked in operating products themselives. I'm one of them myself last year. Developed serval mobile phone games, but I don't know how to sell them and get more users. So operating a product is thinking about how to get users, increase using frequency then make revenue. So the most important reasons involved in as following:

- Solve problems of product
- Increase using frequency
- Get revenue
- Extend life time

## What is Operation

- Think like product manager & use product as much as users
- Provide high quality service for users
- Create revenue
- Optimize product

## How to operate a product

There are differences when operating apps and games. However, they still have something in common. Basically, you should find competitors and track them, find overseas cooperation partners, do ASO job, conduct promotion events and analysis users.
